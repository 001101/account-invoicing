Sort Customer Invoice Lines
============================

This module was written to extend the functionality of customer invoice and allow you to manage sort of lines.

An attribute is added on the customer form to select the sort of invoice lines.
When selecting the customer on an invoice, the sort options are automatically inherited.
If needed, the user can always change it on the invoice without impacting the customer data.
When saving the invoice, all lines are sorted given the sort options selected.

In any cases, the default sort is by sequence ascending.
